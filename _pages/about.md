I am a PhD student at Paris-Saclay University, affiliated with the Mathematics Department at Versailles-St-Quentin University, under the supervision of Prof. [Céline Duval](https://sites.google.com/site/celinehduval/) and Prof. [Ester Mariucci](https://www.estermariucci.com/index.html). My thesis topic is **"Statistics for Jump Processes and Applications."** During my PhD, I have focused on the following areas:  
- **Inference for Stochastic Processes**: Examining the impact of sampling rates on statistical procedures and analyzing discretely observed random processes.  
- **Nonparametric Statistics**: Topics such as density estimation, deconvolution, and adaptive estimation.  
- **Lévy Processes**: Gaussian approximation of small jumps, Stable and Exponentially Tempered Stable Processes...  
- **Monte Carlo Methods for jump process simulation**.

Before joining the Mathematics Laboratory of Versailles (LMV), I earned an MSc in Probability and Statistics from the Paris-Saclay University. In 2019, I graduated with a major in Applied Mathematics from Ecole Polytechnique. My academic journey includes a BSc in pure and applied mathematics at the University Paris-Sud, Orsay obtained in 2016, and a BA in philosophy in 2019 at Nanterre University (parallel with my scientific curriculum). See this [page](https://jalaltaher.github.io/cv/) for a more detailed CV. 

**Research Interests**: *Nonparametric statistics, Stochastic processes, SDE,  Deconvolution, Lévy processes, Stable distributions, Exponential tilting, Monte-Carlo methods...*

**Other**: I'm also trained in classical piano (CEM at Paris-Saclay Conservatory in classical piano). I'm passionate about jazz, harmony, music harmony, and film scoring.
