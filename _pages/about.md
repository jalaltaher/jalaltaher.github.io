I am a PhD student at Pars-Saclay University, affiliated with the Mathematics Department at Versailles-St-Quentin University, under the supervision of Céline Duval and Ester Mariucci. My thesis title is 'Statistics for jump processes and applications'. I have explored the following topics in the context of Lévy processes during my PhD: 
- **Non-parametric statistics for stochastic processes**, density estimation, deconvolution, adaptive estimation...
- **Lévy processes**, 
- **$\alpha-$Stable and Tempered Stable processes**,
- **Numerical sampling of Lévy processes**.

Before joining the Mathematics Laboratory of Versailles (LMV), I earned an MSc in Probability and Statistics from the Paris-Saclay University. In 2019, I graduated with a major in Applied Mathematics from Ecole Polytechnique. My academic journey includes a BSc in pure and applied mathematics at the University Paris-Sud, Orsay obtained in 2016, and a BA in philosophy in 2019 at Nanterre University (parallel with my scientific curriculum).

**Research Interests**: *Nonparametric statistics, Stochastic processes, SDE,  Deconvolution, Lévy processes, Stable distributions, Exponential tilting, Monte-Carlo methods...*





I'm also trained in classical piano (CEM at Paris-Saclay Conservatory in classical piano). I'm passionate about jazz, music production, harmony, and film scoring. I'm a keyboard member of a funk band and a salsa band. See Music page for more details
